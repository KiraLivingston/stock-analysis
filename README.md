# Stock-analysis Challenge

## Project Overview
### The purpose of this project was to collect stock information from the years 2017 and 2018 and refactor the code to determine if stocks are good investments.The original code was acceptable but it needed to run more efficiently than the previous written code.

Project Results
The code ran more efficiently after the refactoring  process.  The code ran faster than the original written code

Summary
Some advantages of refactoring code are making it run better with more efficiency.  It can make it faster, and give more information than the original code which can save time for everyone. A disadvantage may be that you may not always understand the way the original code was written and it may take a while to figure out how to think in the same frame of mind to get the project to work correctly

The advantages and disadvantages were evident in this challenge.  I had to first understand the way the original code was written and write it in my own way so that I could make it run more efficiently but also be able to share the changes with others.
